% Acknowledgement

I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Richard E. Turner for his guidance and support throughout this project. I also would like to thank Matt Ashman for his considerable assistance with the code and theory upon which this project is built on. His insights have been invaluable in shaping my understanding of the material. Furthermore, I would extend my sincere appreciation to Cristiana Diaconu, Startis Markou, James Requeima and Junhyuck Kim for their incredibly helpful discussions and feedback during our supervision meetings. Everyone's advice and insights have been invaluable in shaping this project and my understanding of the material.

Thank you all for your support and contributions.
