Due to the computer based nature of this project, there exists a risk of developing repetitive strain injuries (RSI) due to prolonged use. To mitigate this risk, the following measures were being taken:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Regular breaks 
    \item Peripherals will be positioned at a comfortable distance to reduce strain.
    \item The chair will be positioned at a comfortable height to reduce back strain.
    \item Work in a well-lit room to reduce eye strain.
    
    
\end{itemize}
