\section{Datasets}

We will use the same datasets as the 1D experiments, but extend them to 2D. From both datasets, choose to sample $N_c = 64$ context points and $N_t = 128$ target points. The context region is defined as $x_1, x_2 \in [-2, 2]$ and the target region is defined as $x_1, x_2 \in [-4, 4]$.  In our plots, the context region will be inside a black dotted box and the target region will be inside a red dotted box. The extrapolation region is outside the target region.

\subsection{Gaussian Process}

The 2D Gaussian Process is the natural extension of the 1D Gaussian Process described in \autoref{sec:1d-gp-dataset} where we use the squared exponential kernel. We continue to use the same range of lengthscale across both input dimensions as the 1D Gaussian Process. 

% The following plots show some samples from the GP dataset.

\subsection{Sawtooth}

The 2D Sawtooth dataset is the natural extension of the 1D Sawtooth dataset described in \autoref{sec:1d-sawtooth-dataset}. We continue to use the same period $f$ and noise $n$ across both input dimensions as the 1D Sawtooth dataset.

% The following plots show some samples from the Sawtooth dataset.

% \todo{Add plots of Sawtooth dataset}

\subsection{Restricted Sawtooth}

The restricted sawtooth limits the `direction of travel' of the sawtooth function to the line of $x_1 = x_2$ or $x_1 = -x_2$. Under this dataset the model only learn a subset of the `full sawtooth' function. We can use this probe how well the models can generalize to samples from the full sawtooth function.

% The following plots show some samples from the Restricted Sawtooth dataset.

\section{Post or Pre MLP}

In our original formulation of the TETNP (\autoref{sec:tetnp}) we pass the matrix of differences ($\bm{\Delta}$) between $x$ values through an MLP to apply non-linearities then add it to the dot product attention \autoref{eq:relative-attention}, whilst this performs well we can also consider applying this non-linearity after combining the dot product attention and the relative attention, this method is called the `Post MLP'. The formulation of the `Post MLP' is as follows:

\begin{align}
	\text{Attention}(\bm{Q}, \bm{K}, \bm{V}, \bm{X}) &= \text{softmax}\left(\bm{E} \right) \bm{V}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\text{Pre MLP:} \quad \bm{E_{ij}} &= \bm{D_{ij}}+ \text{MLP}(\bm{\Delta_{ij}})\\
    \text{Post MLP:} \quad \bm{E_{ij}} &= \text{MLP}(\texttt{cat}[ \bm{D_{ij}}, \bm{\Delta_{ij}}])
\end{align}
Where 
\begin{align}
     \bm{D_{ij}} = \bm{q_i} \cdot \bm{k_j}  /\sqrt{d_k} \quad \quad    \bm{\Delta_{ij}} = \bm{x_i} - \bm{x_j}
\end{align}


We will investigate the performance of the TETNP with the `Post MLP' compared to the original `Pre MLP'. The Sawtooth dataset is chosen for this experiment as it is more difficult to learn than the Gaussian Process dataset, thereby allowing us to observe the differences between the two functions more clearly.

    \caption{Validation Loss of TETNP with the `Post MLP' and `Pre MLP' on the 2D Sawtooth Dataset. Lower validation loss is better.}
    \label{fig:post-pre-kernel}
\end{figure}


The results show that the TETNP with the `Post MLP' outperforms the TETNP with the `Pre MLP' by quite a large margin. Trivially the Post function can further refine the dot product attention through the MLP whilst in the `Pre' function the MLP is \emph{only} applied to the $\bm{\Delta}$ matrix. The computational complexity of these two functions are not too different as the MLP are small and applied to matrices of the same size.

\section{Model Comparison}

We have discovered in the 1D section that the TETNP outperforms the vanilla TNP in all cases, hence for the 2D experiments we will only compare the ConvNP to the TETNP. When performing our experiments we will use models which are both 1 million parameters in size, to ensure a fair comparison.

\subsection{Gaussian Process}

As mentioned previously, the Gaussian Process dataset is not very difficult to learn and the ConvNP and TETNP both perform very well on this dataset with the TETNP outperforming the ConvNP by a small margin as shown in \autoref{tab:gp-2d-val-doss}.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
        \toprule
        Model  & Validation Loss \\
        \midrule
        ConvNP & 1.168           \\
        TETNP  & 1.134           \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Validation Loss of ConvNP and TETNP on the 2D Gaussian Process dataset after training for 4 hours using 1 million parameters models and 64 context points. Lower is better.}
    \label{tab:gp-2d-val-doss}
\end{table}

Observing the samples from the ConvNP and TETNP for the 2D Gaussian Process dataset \autoref{fig:high-freq-2d-gps}, we note that both models successfully  learn the underlying process, with the TETNP being able to perform slightly better than the ConvNP. Given the smooth nature of the GP dataset, it is not surprising that both models perform well. To highlight the differences between the ConvNP and TETNP, we will proceed to the Sawtooth dataset which is more difficult to learn.

\subsection{Restricted Sawtooth and Rotational Equivariance}

As previously stated the restricted sawtooth dataset is a subset of the full sawtooth dataset which restricts the `direction of travel' of the sawtooth function to the line of $x_1 = x_2$ or $x_1 = -x_2$. Training the models on this dataset will highlight the generalization ability of the models.
% Figure ./fig/res-saw/te.png and ./fig/res-saw/conv.png

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \subfloat[TETNP]{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./fig/res-saw/te.png}}\\
    \subfloat[ConvNP]{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./fig/res-saw/conv.png}}
    \caption{Samples from TETNP and ConvNP on the Restricted Sawtooth dataset. The region inside the black dotted box is the region the models were trained on and the region outside the black dotted box is the region the models were not trained on. 64 context points were used.}
    \label{fig:res-saw-preds}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:res-saw-preds} shows that the ConvNP performs excellently on this dataset, which is expected as CNNs use filters to learn features and patterns in the data explicitly, allowing them to perform excellently on extrapolation tasks (outside the black dotted box region). The TETNP on the other hand struggles to generalize fully within the target region (red dotted box) and outside the target region. Instead, it learns to extrapolate the sawtooth along one axis, but not the other. This brings to light a limitation of the Transformer architecture - it has very little interpretability which can result in unexpected behavior.

\emph{Is this TETNP able to generalize to the full sawtooth dataset?} To answer this question we will simply run the TETNP on a rotated version of the restricted sawtooth dataset which is the full sawtooth dataset.



% Figure ./fig/res-saw/no-re.png

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./fig/res-saw/no-re.png}
    \caption{Generalization of the TETNP. The context points on the left are rotated by 45 degrees and  the inference is performed on this rotated set giving us the right plot.}
    \label{fig:no-re-saw-preds}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:no-re-saw-preds} we explicitly reduced the target and context region size to allow for the TETNP to cover the full target region. The bottom plot illustrates the predictions when we rotate the context points by 45 degrees, clearly the TETNP completely fails, predicting only a constant mean and standard deviation. It struggles to generalize to rotations, which brings us to the question: \emph{Could introducing rotational equivariance to the TETNP help it generalize to the full sawtooth dataset?}

\subsubsection{Rotational Equivariance}

Introducing rotational equivariance (RE) is relatively straightforward. In our formulation of the Translation Equivariance Attention, we use a pairwise-difference matrix $\bm{\Delta}$ which contains the differences between the $\bm{x}$ values of all the data points.

\begin{align}
    \text{Not RE}: \quad &\bm{\Delta}_{ij} = \bm{x}_i - \bm{x}_j\\
    \text{RE}: \quad &\bm{\Delta}_{ij} = \|\bm{x}_i - \bm{x}_j\|_2
\end{align}

To introduce rotational equivariance we can simply take the L2 norm of the $\bm{\Delta}$ matrix which will give us the distance between all the data points. Distances are invariant to rotation, hence the TETNP should be rotationally equivariant. Using this new $\bm{\Delta}$ matrix we can train the TETNP on the restricted sawtooth dataset and observe if it can generalize to the full sawtooth dataset.

% Figure ./fig/res-saw/re.png

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./fig/res-saw/re.png}
    \caption{Generalization of the RE-TETNP. The context points on the left are rotated by 45 degrees and  the inference is performed on this rotated set giving us the right plot.}
    \label{fig:re-saw-preds}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:re-saw-preds} demonstrates a massive improvement in the TETNP's ability to generalize to the full sawtooth dataset. It has learned to extrapolate the sawtooth in all directions, which is a significant improvement over the non-RE TETNP. Hence, we can conclude that RE is beneficial for the case when the inherent structure of the data is rotationally invariant. This illustrates a massive benefit of the Transformer architecture, as \textbf{it is very easy to introduce inductive biases to the Transformer model}, which is not the case for CNNs.

However, as we will see in the next section, if the data given to the model contains samples from many directions, the model will learn to be RE.

\subsection{Full Sawtooth}

The full sawtooth dataset is the sawtooth function which is not restricted to any direction of travel. We observe that the TETNP is able to generalize to the full sawtooth dataset without the need for rotational equivariance \autoref{fig:full-saw-preds}. 

% Figure ./fig/saw/tetnp.png and ./fig/saw/tetnp2.png and ./fig/saw/tetnp3.png

    \caption{Samples from TETNP and ConvNP on the full Sawtooth dataset after training for 7 hours using 1 million parameters models and 64 context points.

    \label{fig:full-saw-preds}
\end{figure}

The ConvNP performs terribly on the full sawtooth dataset, which may seem surprising at first, but it is not since CNNs are not rotationally equivariant. We hypothesize that the CNN will need to learn filters for the sawtooth in all directions, which is a very difficult task, especially with limited parameters. The ConvNP was able to perform well on the restricted sawtooth dataset as it only needed to learn filters for the sawtooth in \emph{two directions}. Perhaps with longer training times and more parameters, the ConvNP could learn to generalize to the full sawtooth dataset, but this was not considered in this work.

% Compared to the ConvNP the TETNP does indeed perform better in terms of validation loss.

    \label{fig:conv-tetnp-saw}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:conv-tetnp-saw} demonstrates that the TETNP outperforms the ConvNP by a significant margin on the full sawtooth dataset. Overall the TETNP is the clear winner and highlights the power of the Transformer architecture in learning complex patterns in the data.

\autoref{tab:memory-usage-comparison-2D} clearly demonstrates that the ConvNPs memory requirement has increased by a factor of $2^3$ compared to the 1D case \autoref{tab:memory-usage-comparison}, which agrees with the theoretical complexity of the ConvNP. On the other hand, the TETNP retains the same memory requirements as the 1D case, although it remains higher than the ConvNP. When scaling systems to higher dimensions (3D, 4D, etc.), the TETNP will be more memory-efficient than the ConvNP and will likely be the preferred choice.
